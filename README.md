WIA1002 DATA STRUCTURE - GROUP PROJECT 2024
TOPIC 5 - HACKING THE FUTURE
by Occ 9 Fantastic Four

This project seeks to solve young children's lack of exposure to interesting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) activities by creating an interactive platform that encourages STEM learning. The process involves creating basic and additional features to improve the project's functionality, matching it with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals for quality education, innovation, and partnership. The three user roles (student, parent, and instructor) each have their own functions and abilities that contribute to the richness and fun of the platform. Aside from the extra features recommended in the guidelines, our group opted to include a forum discussion page and account validation function to make this platform more interactive and secure.
